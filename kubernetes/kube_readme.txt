To deploy your application to Kubernetes, apply the configuration files you've created to the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl.

Apply the Deployment and Service:

kubectl -n webapp apply -f flask-deployment.yaml
kubectl -n webapp apply -f flask-service.yaml
This will create the deployment and the service in your Kubernetes cluster.

Check the status of your deployment:

kubectl -n webapp get deployments


Check the status of your pods:

kubectl -n webapp get pods


Check the status of your service:

kubectl -n webapp get services
If you're using a LoadBalancer type service, Kubernetes will provision a public IP for your application, which might take a few minutes depending on your cloud provider. If you're using kubectl port-forward, you can directly access the app using localhost.

Port Forwarding (for local access):
If you're using a local Kubernetes environment like Minikube or Docker Desktop, you can forward the service port to your local machine:


kubectl port-forward svc/flask-sql-app-service 8080:80
You should now be able to access your Flask app at http://localhost:8080.

Step 4: Access the Flask App
If you've used a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure), Kubernetes will expose your application using a LoadBalancer and assign a public IP address. You can access your app using this IP.

To check the external IP:


kubectl get svc flask-sql-app-service
Look for the EXTERNAL-IP column. Once the external IP is assigned, open your browser and go to http://<EXTERNAL-IP>, where you should see your Flask application.

Step 5: Scaling and Monitoring (Optional)
Scaling the Application:
You can scale your app by increasing the number of replicas in the flask-deployment.yaml file.

yaml
Copy code
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Increase the number of replicas to scale horizontally
After modifying the YAML, reapply the changes:


kubectl apply -f flask-deployment.yaml
Monitoring the App:
You can monitor the status of your Kubernetes deployment and pods using the following commands:


kubectl get pods
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
If you need logs, you can get them from a pod:


kubectl logs <pod-name>
Step 6: Clean Up (Optional)
If you want to remove the resources you just deployed, you can run:


kubectl -n webapp delete -f flask-deployment.yaml
kubectl -n webapp delete -f flask-service.yaml
Summary
To deploy your Flask app to Kubernetes:

Push the Docker image to a container registry.
Create Kubernetes YAML files for the Deployment, Service, and (optionally) Persistent Volume.
Apply the configuration to Kubernetes using kubectl apply.
Access the app using the external IP from the LoadBalancer or port-forwarding for local environments.
This will allow you to scale your app and run it in a containerized environment managed by Kubernetes.
